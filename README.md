# Pamaxie DevEnvs
### It is with a hard feeling in our heart, that we have to announce, that Pamaxie as a project is cancelled. Due to lacking funds and massive changes in the project owners life (Leejja) we currently no longer have the financial or time capacity to maintain it which is why we think it is best that we close this chapter of our life. We are sorry that we could not live up to our promises. We are looking into a cheap way to host our dataset. If possible we may update this page. Due to concerns for the public we might not however (there is some graphic imagry in there which may be quite disturbing or problematic to release)

[![Publish Database API Docker Image](https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie.DevEnvs/actions/workflows/docker-publish-db-api.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie.DevEnvs/actions/workflows/docker-publish-db-api.yml)

This Repository contains individual build scripts for our development enviorements. These dev enviorements are there to ease development and make it quicker for us to work on our service.
The individual docker containers are all meant to develop on different APIs, please follow our tutorial (going to be added soon) on our (wiki)[https://wiki.pamaxie.com] on which container to use for which enviorement.
Our databases are already populated with data. We will add information shortly what this data looks like and what individual credentials are to help interaction with the containers.
We are still working on the containers and do not recommend using them as of now. We will make a release once they can be used for development.
