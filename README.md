# Pamaxie DevEnvs

This Repository contains individual build scripts for our development enviorements. These dev enviorements are there to ease development and make it quicker for us to work on our service.
The individual docker containers are all meant to develop on different APIs, please follow our tutorial (going to be added soon) on our (wiki)[https://wiki.pamaxie.com] on which container to use for which enviorement.
Our databases are already populated with data. We will add information shortly what this data looks like and what individual credentials are to help interaction with the containers.
We are still working on the containers and do not recommend using them as of now. We will make a release once they can be used for development.
